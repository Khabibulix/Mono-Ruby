Command line only program that looks for path for a knight on a chess board

Credits: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hangman

<h2>How to launch</h2><br>
Go in main directory and type:
<pre>
bundle install
ruby .\main.rb
</pre>

<h2>How the project is organized</h2><br>
My sourcecode is in <em>lib</em> folder and contains two files: <br>
<br>
<pre>
    . knight.rb
    . node.rb
</pre>

All the main logic including my solution for path checking is in <em>knight.rb</em>

<h2>Objectives:</h2><br>

The main goal was to learn about data structures and about Graphs especially. I didn't use a Graph but a sort of adjacency matrix, in my case a 3d Array containing nodes. 

<h2>How this project made me better:</h2><br>

I tested several logic including hashes, graphs and i learned a lot about it. I don't think my solution is the optimal one and i don't think it will be one day.
