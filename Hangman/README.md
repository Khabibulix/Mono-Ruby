<h2>How to launch</h2><br>
Go in main directory and type:
<pre>ruby .\main.rb</pre>

<h2>How the project is organized</h2><br>
My sourcecode is in <em>lib</em> folder and contains two files: <br>
<br>
<pre>
    . utilities.rb
    . game.rb
</pre>

<h2>Objectives:</h2><br>

The main goal was to learn about serialization, that's why i used JSON in this project, mainly to save and load the current state of the game. 

<h2>How this project made me better:</h2><br>

I learned about writing, about accessing JSON data.

I also used this project to enhance my test skill. The tests are made using Minitest, the test coverage is not complete but good enough for such a small project.
