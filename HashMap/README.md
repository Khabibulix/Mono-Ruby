Second project on data structures, this time on Hash Map.

<h2>How this project made me better:</h2><br>

I learned about hashmaps, more than with the dedicated lesson to be honest. I understood that a hashmap contains mini LinkedList and that the access is faster.

I struggled at the beginning to understand the assignment but i'm pretty confident now.
