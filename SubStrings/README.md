Second little project for The Odin Project Ruby Path

Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

Original data structure:
    dictionary = ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy","it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]

What should be returned:
    > substrings("below", dictionary)
    => { "below" => 1, "low" => 1 }
